AstraNova Client is a desktop application built with Rust and Iced, designed to provide a user-friendly interface for making HTTP requests. It allows users to specify URLs, HTTP methods, headers, and request bodies, and then displays the response.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. If you don't have them, you can install them using `rustup`:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Running the Application

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/astranova-client.git
    cd astranova-client
    ```

    *(Note: Replace `https://github.com/your-username/astranova-client.git` with the actual repository URL if it's hosted elsewhere.)*

2.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```

    This command will compile the application and then run it. The application window should appear.

## Built With

*   [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - A language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.
*   [Iced](https://iced.rs/) - A cross-platform GUI library for Rust, inspired by Elm.
